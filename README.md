# Polynomial Simplification 
## Kayton Fletcher

To compile the program, run **make**

The input files take the form of _p#.in_ where # is any number
from 1 to the number of tests. When you run **make tests**, it will
create output files that correspond to the given input file, namely _p#.out_

If you change the code at all, insure you run **make clean** before
recompiling with **make**
